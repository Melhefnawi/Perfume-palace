It has the site logo on the left side and the search bar in the center, below these two elements we find the navigation links for Home, About Us, all perfumes (dropdown menu), category(dropdown menu), special offers.
  - The navigation bar is fully responsive thanks to the use of Bootstrap, also the layout changes to expandable and fully vertical once small screens are used.
  - When small screens are used the search icon is clickable and once clicked on, it drops down a search bar.
    
    - The navigation menu is identical across all the pages on the site which provides quick navigation learning.

![NavBar](documentation/nav-bar.png)

- **Home/Index**

  - The home page welcomes the user (new or returning) to the site, it subtly and intuitively shows the user what the site is about  and what it offers, which is a site about perfume where users can easily find perfume for different brands, price, and categories, giving them as well a call to action button to start shopping.

  - The register page also provides a link for the user to go to the login page in case they're already registered as well as a back to login button.
    - This functionality is achieved thanks to the power of Django allauth.

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/leonardo-simeone/perfumesground-store/projects?query=is%3Aclosed) served as an Agile tool for this project.
It isn't a specialized tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.

Through it, user stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned, then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic Kanban board.


### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/leonardo-simeone/perfumesground-store/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) served as an another Agile tool.
There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.

It also helped with milestone iterations on a weekly basis.

- [Open Issues](https://github.com/leonardo-simeone/perfumesground-store/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue), There is only one open issue remaining (won't have) which will be addressed in a future iteration along with other issues to come for [Future Features](#future-features), [Link here](https://github.com/leonardo-simeone/perfumesground-store/issues/20).

![screenshot](documentation/gh-issues-open.png)

- [Closed Issues](https://github.com/leonardo-simeone/perfumesground-store/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

![screenshot](documentation/gh-issues-closed.png)

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into stories prior to prioritizing and implementing them.
Using this approach, I was able to apply the MoSCow prioritization and labels to my user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (_max 60% of stories_)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (_the rest ~20% of stories_)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (_20% of stories_)


## Ecommerce Business Model

This site sells perfumes to individual customers, and therefore follows a `Business to Customer` model.
It is of the simplest **B2C** forms, as it focuses on individual transactions, and doesn't need anything
such as monthly/annual subscriptions.

It is still in its early development stages, although it already has a newsletter, and links for social media marketing.

Social media can potentially build a community of users around the business, and boost site visitor numbers,
especially when using larger platforms such a Facebook.

A newsletter list can be used by the business to send regular messages to site users.
For example, what items are on special offer, new items in stock,
updates to business hours, notifications of events, and much more!

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO) & Social Media Marketing

### Keywords

I've identified some appropriate keywords to align with my site, that should help users
when searching online to find my page easily from a search engine.
This included a series of the following keyword types

- Short-tail (head terms) keywords
- Long-tail keywords

![screenshot](documentation/keywords-selection.png)




#### Final AWS Setup

- If Heroku Config Vars has `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` still, this can be removed now, so that AWS will handle the static files.
- Back within **S3**, create a new folder called: `media`.
- Select any existing media images for your project to prepare them for being uploaded into the new folder.
- Under **Manage Public Permissions**, select **Grant public read access to this object(s)**.
- No further settings are required, so click **Upload**.

### Stripe API

This project uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to handle the ecommerce payments.

Once you've created a Stripe account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click to expand the "Get your test API keys".
- You'll have two keys here:
  - `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` = Publishable Key (starts with **pk**)
  - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = Secret Key (starts with **sk**)

As a backup, in case users prematurely close the purchase-order page during payment, we can include Stripe Webhooks.

- I understand that to achieve robust security and reliability in the checkout process, the use of webhooks is recommended, however due to a matter of time, I didn't implement webhooks for this project. It is though one of the future features I want to implement. The steps to implement them are as follow:
  - From your Stripe dashboard, click **Developers**, and select **Webhooks**.
  - From there, click **Add Endpoint**.
    - `https://perfumesground-store-6596e524f29e.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/`
  - Click **receive all events**.
  - Click **Add Endpoint** to complete the process.
  - You'll have a new key here:
    - `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` = Signing Secret (Wehbook) Key (starts with **wh**)

### Gmail API

This project uses [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) to handle sending emails to users for account verification and purchase order confirmations.

Once you've created a Gmail (Google) account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- Click on the **Account Settings** (cog icon) in the top-right corner of Gmail.
- Click on the **Accounts and Import** tab.
- Within the section called "Change account settings", click on the link for **Other Google Account settings**.
- From this new page, select **Security** on the left.
- Select **2-Step Verification** to turn it on. (verify your password and account)
- Once verified, select **Turn On** for 2FA.
- Navigate back to the **Security** page, and you'll see a new option called **App passwords**.
- This might prompt you once again to confirm your password and account.
- Select **Mail** for the app type.
- Select **Other (Custom name)** for the device type.
  - Any custom name, such as "Django" or perfumesground-store
- You'll be provided with a 16-character password (API key).
  - Save this somewhere locally, as you cannot access this key again later!
  - `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` = user's 16-character API key
  - `EMAIL_HOST_USER` = user's own personal Gmail email address

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.


### Local VS Deployment

The only difference I found between local version and heroku deployment, was the verification emails. When Sign up or Order completed processes ocurred, the verification emails were not sent in the real world but to the developement terminal instead, whereas in the deployed version emails were sent to the actual emails provided by the user.
